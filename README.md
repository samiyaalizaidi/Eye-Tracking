# Identifying ASD Symptoms using Eye Tracking Techniques

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects millions of children globally, impacting their social interaction, communication skills, and behavior. Early diagnosis (ideally before age 3) is essential for maximizing the effectiveness of interventions and improving long-term outcomes. However, current diagnostic methods often rely on behavioral observations, which can be subjective and time-consuming.

This project focuses on exploring the potential of eye-tracking technology combined with deep learning for early detection of ASD. Eye movements provide valuable insights into an individualâ€™s visual attention and information processing. Studies suggest that children with ASD exhibit atypical gaze patterns, including reduced attention to faces and social cues.

## Project Goals

1. **Develop a Generic Eye Tracking Model:**
   - Implement a baseline model using existing eye-tracking datasets.

2. **Analyze ASD-Specific Patterns:**
   - Identify and analyze unique eye movement patterns in ASD patients.

3. **Fine-Tune Model for ASD Detection:**
   - Adjust the generic model to better detect ASD-specific patterns.

4. **Evaluate and Iterate:**
   - Assess the performance of the fine-tuned model and continuously improve it.
